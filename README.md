## About the Project

This project was developed as part of the coursework at ISI Kolkata. It focuses on matrix decomposition, specifically LU decomposition, which breaks down a non-singular square matrix into a product of a Lower Triangular matrix and an Upper Triangular matrix. This decomposition simplifies complex matrix operations, making the system of equations easier to handle and computationally efficient.

Additionally, Presentations covering the numerical analysis and the implementation in the project are attached for reference. 

## Features:
- **Efficient Matrix Decomposition:** Decomposes any non-singular square matrix into Lower (L) and Upper (U) triangular matrices.
- **Solution of Linear Systems:** After decomposition,upon the user-request, the program solves systems of linear equations using forward and backward substitution.
- **Determinant Calculation:** The program can compute the determinant of the matrix also upon user-request.

This project is ideal for anyone needing a reliable tool for matrix manipulation or solving large systems of linear equations.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to **Prof. Pinak Pani Pal** at ISI Kolkata for their valuable guidance and support.
